  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>If there is one thing everyone has fantasised about at least
once in their lives, it is the ability to be invisible. Not
stealthy, not a social pariah, but transparent. Animals are
some of the finest biological examples; although not true cloaking, they manage to hide in plain sight due to the color of their
fur, which is the result of millions of years of evolution. But
what if you could become totally see-through, making you literally invisible? Well, that’s exactly what metamaterials can do.
They are capable of bending light around an object, making
it impossible to see that object. Imagine wearing the invisibility cloak from the Harry Potter series, only this one is not
magic but made of incredibly precise, manufactured materials.
These materials are made of tiny structures that are smaller
than the wavelength of light and can have a negative index
of refraction, which makes them capable of manipulating the
electromagnetic radiation that comes in contact with them.
Using Einstein’s theory of relativity as a crux, we can calculate
how light would bend in those materials, making it possible to
bend all different frequencies of light, resulting in total invisibility. This idea is very well described by imagining a rock in
the middle of a river. The water would flow around the rock
and continue on its path.

<h1>Metamaterials of invisibility</h1>
  <p>M
etamaterials are made of artificial structures composed
of conventional materials like plastics and metals arranged in a certain "lattice". They are made from
countless tiny structures that are smaller than the wavelength
of the light that is incident on them, allowing the creator to
control how electromagnetic waves bend around the object,
making it impossible for light to interact with it in any way.
These structures are called meta-atoms, and they’re "created"
to specifically fit the metamaterial model. These meta-atoms
have a negative index of refraction causing the light incident
on them to bend in the opposite direction to that of normal
materials. These meta-atoms are not real atoms but instead
small structures that can be made from copper or split-ring
resonators, which are made to interact with specific frequencies
of light. To have a negative refractive index, the meta-atoms
must exhibit both negative permittivity and negative permeability. Another form of such materials are photonic crystals
and quasicrystals. They are a special type of crystal structure materials that maintain their symmetry in multiple planes,
more than current crystallography rules allow for. They were
first noticed in some alloys of aluminium and manganese, and
they have quickly become a very interesting topic for physicists
worldwide.</p>
  <h1>The Physics of the process</h1>
<p>T
o understand the physics of metamaterials, it is imperative to first understand the physics of Optics. The
reason why we can see things around us is that electromagnetic radiation (light) bounces off the things around us
and into our eyes. In that process, some specific wavelengths
of light, due to the structure of the materials themselves, are
absorbed while some are expelled. The ones absorbed never
reach us, while the ones expelled are the ones entering our
eyes. That’s why the colour of a pepper is green and not
purple, because the cells of the pepper absorb all other wavelengths of light, BUT the green one. For an object to be colored
black, the material of which the object is comprised absorbs all
wavelengths of light, giving none of them back, whereas being
coloured white means it absorbs no wavelengths and refracts
all of them. Metametarials make it possible for the light to
literally slip past the internal structure of the material, making
it bounce off the objects around it and not the material itself.
This is because of the negative index of refraction, which simply means that the light that is incident on the surface of the
material refracts in the opposite direction from what it does for
normal materials and therefore never reaches our eyes.</p>
